# Coyote's Portfolio

***Still Working On It***

View [The site](https://portolio-livid.vercel.app)!

*Notice there is typo on the name of the site `portolio` XD...*

This project is my notes site generator powered by [Nextra](https://nextra.site).

## How it works

The doc site is generated on the internet through steps:

1. Start the build pipeline(github workflows) trigger by the [Doc Repo](https://github.com/CoyoteWaltz/MarkdownNotes)'s event
2. Run layout scripts to build the content(`pages/`, `_meta.json`, ...)
3. Push commits for those changes
4. Build and Deploy to Vercel
5. View the website!
