# Coyote's Portfolio

***Still Working On It***

View [The site](https://portfolio.coyotedemon.xyz/)!

<!-- *Notice there is typo on the name of the site `portolio` XD...* -->

This project is my notes site generator powered by [Nextra](https://nextra.site).

## How it works

The doc site is generated to the internet through steps below:

1. Run the build pipeline(github workflows) triggered by the [Doc Repo](https://github.com/CoyoteWaltz/MarkdownNotes)'s event.
2. Run layout scripts to build the layout and the content(`pages/`, `_meta.json`, ...).
3. Push commits for those changes back to the repo.
4. Build and Deploy to Vercel.
5. Visit the website!
